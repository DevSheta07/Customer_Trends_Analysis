# Customer Trends Analysis Project

An end-to-end data analytics project covering Python, SQL, Power BI, reporting, and business presentation.

---

## ◼ Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer data to generate meaningful business insights.
The objective was to understand customer patterns, identify trends, and support data-driven decisions through structured analysis and visualization.

The project follows a complete analytics workflow — starting from raw data processing in Python to SQL-based analysis, interactive dashboard creation in Power BI, and finally delivering insights through a formal report and presentation.

## ◼ Dataset

* Format: CSV file
* Type: Structured customer dataset
* Key fields include:

  * Customer demographics
  * Purchase details
  * Product categories
  * Revenue metrics
  * Subscription status

The dataset was carefully cleaned and validated before analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## ◼ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading

* Imported dataset using Pandas
* Verified schema, column types, and structure

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Checked missing values
* Analyzed data distributions
* Explored correlations
* Created visual summaries

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Removed duplicates
* Handled null values
* Standardized categorical variables
* Corrected inconsistent formats

### 4. SQL Analysis

* Imported cleaned data into database
* Executed:

  * GROUP BY queries
  * SUM, AVG, COUNT aggregations
  * Segmentation analysis
  * Revenue-based insights

### 5. Power BI Development

* Connected database to Power BI
* Created calculated measures using DAX
* Designed interactive report pages
* Added slicers for dynamic filtering
* Built KPI summary cards

### 6. Reporting & Presentation

* Documented findings in a structured report
* Developed a professional presentation highlighting key insights and recommendations

## ◼ Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI report includes:

* Revenue analysis by product category
* Customer segmentation insights
* Subscription behavior trends
* Demographic comparisons
* KPI cards (Total Revenue, Active Customers, etc.)
* Interactive filters for deeper exploration

The dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly understand performance patterns and customer behavior.
